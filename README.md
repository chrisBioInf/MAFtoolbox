# MAFtoolbox

A bioinformatics utility tool box that implements a number of programs for operations on (genome) alignments 
in Multiple Alignment Format. 
It started out as a software for merging highly fragmented neighboring MAF alignment blocks 
into larger continous one and developed into allowing such things as extracting subblocks 
of existing alignments based on gene annotation files, filtering sequences for simlarity thresholds and much more.

A lot of the functionality implemented here is ultimately geared towards and 
useful when trying to screen for gene and structure conservation signals, as these typically get lost in the noise
when connected blocks do not cover enough ground or alignments get broken up by mis- or only partially aligned sequences.
